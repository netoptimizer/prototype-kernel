Blogposts, Reports and Write-ups
================================

This documentation area is used for publishing reports and write-ups
of my work, which I find relevant for other people.  This will closely
resemble previous `my blogposts`_.  Hoping using this rst-text format
will make it less of an hassle to publish my work.  (This directory is
not intented to be integrated with the kernels documentation tree).
